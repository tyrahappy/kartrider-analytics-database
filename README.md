## Project Overview

**KartRider Analytics** is a full-stack database management and analytics web platform for a kart racing game. The project includes a relational database in **MySQL** and an interactive web application built with **PHP**, supporting player management, dynamic SQL queries, and game performance analytics.

It demonstrates best practices in:
- Database design (3NF/BCNF normalization)
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete with cascade)
- Analytical query building
- Dashboard data visualization

## Database Design

### Entity-Relationship (ER) Summary

```
Player (1:1) ↔ PlayerCredentials
Player (1:1) ↔ RegisteredPlayer/GuestPlayer
Player (1:M) → Participation (M:1) ← Race
Participation (1:M) → LapRecord
Kart (1:1) ↔ KartDetails
Kart (1:1) ↔ SpeedKart/ItemKart
Track (1:M) → Race
Achievement (M:M) ↔ Player (via PlayerAchievement)
```

### Table Categories

| **Player Management**     | **Game Activities**   | **Game Assets**   |
|---------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Player                    | Race                   | Kart              |
| PlayerCredentials         | Participation          | KartDetails       |
| RegisteredPlayer/GuestPlayer | LapRecord           | SpeedKart/ItemKart|
| PlayerAchievement         |                        | Track, Achievement|

### Key Design Features
- Fully normalized (3NF/BCNF)
- Foreign keys with **ON DELETE CASCADE**
- Check constraints for data validity (e.g., `FinishingRank BETWEEN 1 AND 8`)
- Strategic indexes for performance

## Web Functionalities

### Profile Management (CRUD)
- Register new player
- Update player profile (username, email, profile picture)
- Delete player with cascade (removes participation, achievements)

### Dynamic Query Module
- **Join Query** – Top players with achievements
- **Aggregation Query** – Average playtime & total achievements
- **Nested Group-By** – Weekly playtime analysis
- **Filtering & Ranking** – Top 5 players by win count
- **Custom Query** – Free SQL SELECT with safety constraints

### Dashboard Analytics
- **Player Stats:** player counts, active rates, type distributions
- **Session Stats:** race participation, kart usage, track difficulty
- **Achievement Stats:** progress, rare achievements, completion rates

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
- MySQL 8.0+ or MariaDB 10.4+
- Apache + PHP (XAMPP, MAMP, or PHP server)
- phpMyAdmin (optional)

### 1.Quick Setup
1. Import database schema:
   ```bash
   mysql -u username -p < kartrider_ddl.sql
   mysql -u username -p < kartrider_data.sql
   ```
2. Configure `db_connection.php`:
   ```php
   $conn = new mysqli('localhost', 'root', 'password', 'KartRiderAnalytics');
   ```
3. Deploy `htdocs/` to your PHP server root.
4. Open browser: `http://localhost/dashboard.php`

### 2.Repository Setup
bash# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tyrahappy/kartrider-analytics-database.git
cd kartrider-analytics-database

## Sample SQL Queries

### Player Performance
```sql
SELECT pc.UserName, COUNT(*) AS TotalWins
FROM Participation p
JOIN PlayerCredentials pc ON p.PlayerID = pc.PlayerID
WHERE p.FinishingRank = 1
GROUP BY pc.UserName
ORDER BY TotalWins DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Kart Usage
```sql
SELECT k.KartName, COUNT(*) AS UsageCount
FROM Participation p
JOIN Kart k ON p.KartID = k.KartID
GROUP BY k.KartName
ORDER BY UsageCount DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Race Distribution by Difficulty
```sql
SELECT t.TrackDifficulty, COUNT(*) AS RaceCount
FROM Race r
JOIN Track t ON r.TrackName = t.TrackName
GROUP BY t.TrackDifficulty;
```
## Additional Features

Table Browser: Complete database exploration with search/sort
Interactive Filters: Time period and demographic filtering
Real-time Updates: Live data refresh with intelligent caching
Security: Enterprise-grade SQL injection prevention

## Dashboard Preview

| Module        | Key Metrics                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Player Stats  | Total players, active players, win rates  |
| Session Stats | Race counts, kart usage, track popularity |
| Achievement   | Total achievements, rarest, completion %  |

> With filters by time range and player type.
